# Capstone-Project-Haven

### Intro 

The subject of our project is studying refugee resettlement and its outcomes within the United States. We are aiming to understand what factors influence the success of a refugeeâ€™s life post-resettlement.

### Dataset

This project uses data gathered from the Annual Survey of Refugees. This survey is conducted by the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), a program within the US Department of Health and Human Services. More information on the dataset can be found on the [ORR site](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/programs/refugees/annual-survey-refugees).
