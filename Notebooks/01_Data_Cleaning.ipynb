As these surveys change slightly year over year, along with the formatting or data entered, there is significant work to be done to combine these datasets. Additionally, several questions are never asked by the interviewer and thus columns have a significant number of empty cells, imputing information will be another heavy lift fulfilled in this notebook.\n",
