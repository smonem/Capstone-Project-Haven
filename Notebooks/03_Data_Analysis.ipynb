    "Constructed variables come from combinations of questions that were asked during the survey. For example, here is the definition of the Employment (ui_emprate) feature from the user guide:\n",

    "*ui_emprate: This variable reports individuals’ employment status: employed, unemployed, not in the labor force, or doesn’t know or refused to respond. It was created using responses to qn5a and qn13. Individuals are considered “employed” if they report working at a job anytime the week before survey administration (qn5a), “unemployed” if they report not working at a job anytime the week before survey administration (qn5a) and looking for work during the four weeks before survey administration (qn13), and “not in the labor force” if they report not working at a job anytime the week before survey administration (qn5a) and either report not looking for work during the four weeks before survey administration, don’t know, or refuse to respond (qn13). Respondents who either don’t know or refuse to respond to qn5a are marked “Don’t know and/or refused” for ui_emprate.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We aren't going to go too deep into analysis of these features as we view them more as the outcome of the survey, and what we based our success metric on, but there are a few quick takeaways worth mentioning. As reported, most of the respondents are active in the work force and are currently working. Given their role in the work force, it isn't a surprise to see that very few are in school. Lastly, while most respondents receive public assistance, this assistance isn’t in the form of cash assistance, which includes Temporary Assistance for Need Families (TANF), Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and General Assistance (GA).\n"
