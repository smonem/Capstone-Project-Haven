Examples of this could be the Fars people seeing about half their respondents having arrived in 2016, while they saw all of their representation appear in 2017's survey.

    "For categorical features, a few callouts come to mind. The gender representation in the dataset skews rather heavily toward males, and if it turns out that this feature has an impact on the outcome of our models, it might be worth looking more into. While the dataset unfortunately doesn't go as granular as the state where the respondent resides, it does have the region, and there is a pretty even distribution between the regions, aside from the northeast which has considerably less representation.\n",

    "One interesting piece of information this survey collects is how well the respondent spoke English prior to entering the United States, and at the time of survey. Understanding if there is a correlation between an individual improving in this metric, and their success status is certainly worth looking into.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there is a drastic difference in the number of respondents renting versus owning their home, with nearly 6x as many renting. This is the opposite of the national numbers where only 36% of individuals rent their home (https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2021/08/02/as-national-eviction-ban-expires-a-look-at-who-rents-and-who-owns-in-the-u-s/).

It was created using responses to qn5a and qn13. Individuals are considered “employed” if they report working at a job anytime the week before survey administration (qn5a), “unemployed” if they report not working at a job anytime the week before survey administration (qn5a) and looking for work during the four weeks before survey administration (qn13), and “not in the labor force” if they report not working at a job anytime the week before survey administration (qn5a) and either report not looking for work during the four weeks before survey administration, don’t know, or refuse to respond (qn13). Respondents who either don’t know or refuse to respond to qn5a are marked “Don’t know and/or refused” for ui_emprate.*\n",

    "We aren't going to go too deep into analysis of these features as we view them more as the outcome of the survey, and what we based our success metric on, but there are a few quick takeaways worth mentioning. As reported, most of the respondents are active in the work force and are currently working. Given their role in the work force, it isn't a surprise to see that very few are in school. Lastly, while most respondents receive public assistance, this assistance isn’t in the form of cash assistance, which includes Temporary Assistance for Need Families (TANF), Refugee Cash Assistance (RCA), Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and General Assistance (GA).\n"
